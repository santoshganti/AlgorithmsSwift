# Algorithms using Swift

A repository with a collection of data structures, algorithms and some leetcode questions done using Swift on xcode but also can be run on linux with vscode (or vscodium) or vim (you do you). 

PS: There will be more repositories in some of my favorite languages including Python, Go, Rust, Java, C and Typescript (Sorry Javascript fans)

## What kind of problems are solved under this repository ?

From basic data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, Trees and Trie all the way to some graph algorithms, dynamic programming and some leetcode problems.
